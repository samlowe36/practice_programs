# practice_programs
a grouping of small python programs and projects to practice a variety of fundamentals
will be throwing a variety of simple to more complex miscellaneous python programs and projects into this.

The first is a simple program that will send an email through gmail. It works perfectly and only needs a second confidential file that provides the sender, the receiver, the subject and body of the email, and the app password. super simple stuff.
the wird_replacement is an extremely simple starter program that just has a phrase and allows you to choose a word to replace and what to replace it with.
